PLEASE READ.

This homework assignment was less than helpful for the learning experience.

it is this student's opinion that this could have been a week with a singular homework assignment. Due to the fact that we are assignmed this peice with one set of tools and then over the period of time that we have to work on it. We learn a much better and more fluid set of tools to do the same thing.

By Thursday night, I had become so confused that I have several technologies in my folder that confuse the data and obscure it even further. I understand the concepts but lacked the time to practice them. To this end, my assignment is incomplete.

To my defense, I understand how this assignment could have been accomplished using MySQL, Handlebars, Express, body-parser, and path. I have included the schema for the MySQL database, the proper method to POST to it (albeit the .then(); is non-functional due to the circumstances, this is commented out), and included pathing to the friends.js file as well.

I feel like I was very close to accomplishing the goal and that I would have been able to, had this particular homework been the only one for this week.

Having a solo activity that takes an entire week to complete outside of school hours is, I think, a good exercise that I think brings a lot of value to the class. And that the friendFinder task could have been that activity.
